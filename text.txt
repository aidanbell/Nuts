Main Gameplay:

-Big button > Get(just gets nuts)
  This is the first way to collect nuts.

Squirrel Get:
  - Squirrels will come randomly at first
  - chance will be effected by:
        - total nuts gathered
        - future upgrades
        - total squirrels
  -
  - Once you get a squirrel, you unlock auto gets, which must be staffed by at
    least one squirrel

  - GOOD IDEA:
    -Squirrel Stocks - Allow you to borrow nuts

  For each get functions, there will be these mutable variables:
    - Value: the amount of the base end result
    - Multi: the base multiplier. Can be effected with:
        - +%Multi
        - +#Multi
    - Time: the amount of time (ms) the action will take

-EQUIPS/SHINY ROCKS
    - Equips will drop randomly, or later maybe crafted?
    - Following Possible Upgrades:
        - w1-w4:
          - +#val (adds to base value)
          - +%val (% gain after base value additions are made)
          - -%time (decreases amount of time/action)
          - +%multi (increases multi)

  EXPLORE:
    - having multiple gameloops so each function can be effected
    - exponential growth on prices
    -
